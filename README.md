### Reflection

- Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

The CSS portion of the project. Even though it is the easiest to see how it changes multiple elements in real time. It is one of the hardest to pick up because of the many elements within it.

- If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
I would've like to continued designing my page with CSS. I had a trial and error approach with it, the issue with this is that I would later find a better way to execute or change an element. But I would then have to go back into my code to see what line of code I need to erase as it doesn't have any impact on my code currently.

- Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

Something I didn't take into account when starting this project is not knowing how stressful it can be to juggle three different files. It was something new to me, but this expierence has lead me to learn more how to navigate this situation better and learn. What my peers did is do a lot of trial and error for CSS, in the sense that they kept doing different things until they were able to get the outcome they want. Which in turn helps you learn as you can see what you need to do to do a specific event.
